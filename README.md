The Hotel Booking Prediction project is a machine learning initiative aimed at predicting the likelihood of hotel bookings based on various customer and booking characteristics. The project leverages the powerful data manipulation and analysis libraries NumPy and Pandas to preprocess and wrangle the data. For visual insights, Matplotlib and Seaborn are used to create meaningful plots that help understand patterns and trends within the dataset.
